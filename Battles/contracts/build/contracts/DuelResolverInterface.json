For efficiency, y values are rounded to the nearest 1/64th\n (which seemed in our testing to be the sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency).\n\n    /// This function will produce wholly accurate results for all integer powers (i.e.\n when y is a multiple of 1024 when viewed as an int), and will produce reasonable results\n when y has a fractional component. The error term on this approximation isn't tiny, but\n over the range 0-1 the errors tend to cancel out, which means the integral of the approximation\n is VERY close to the integral of the real power function. This is critical, because we use\n this approximation for determining the power transfer after a duel. This approximation can\n result in errors, but systemically - across a large number of fights - those errors will\n cancel out and result in a system very close to the expected equilibrium.\n\n    /// tl;dr We fake the power function in a way that means that any error the approximation introduces\n is just as likely to help you as hurt you, while saving a butt-ton of gas.",

For efficiency, y values are rounded to the nearest 1/64th\n (which seemed in our testing to be the sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency).\n\n    /// This function will produce wholly accurate results for all integer powers (i.e.\n when y is a multiple of 1024 when viewed as an int), and will produce reasonable results\n when y has a fractional component. The error term on this approximation isn't tiny, but\n over the range 0-1 the errors tend to cancel out, which means the integral of the approximation\n is VERY close to the integral of the real power function. This is critical, because we use\n this approximation for determining the power transfer after a duel. This approximation can\n result in errors, but systemically - across a large number of fights - those errors will\n cancel out and result in a system very close to the expected equilibrium.\n\n    /// tl;dr We fake the power function in a way that means that any error the approximation introduces\n is just as likely to help you as hurt you, while saving a butt-ton of gas.",
